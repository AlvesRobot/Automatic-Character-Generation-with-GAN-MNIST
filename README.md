# Automatic-Character-Generation-with-GAN-MNIST
The content refers to an example application of GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks). The goal is to generate characters automatically. The database used for training the neural network was MNIST (handwritten digit data). The practical example was implemented in Jupyter Notebook. I used TensorFlow 2.0 and Python 3.
